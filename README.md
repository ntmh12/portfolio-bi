# 👩‍💻 Nguyen Thi Minh Huong

Welcome to my Business Intelligence Portfolio! I'm a Business Intelligence with a background in economics, and hands-on experience in customer analytics, sentiment analysis, ETL/ELT, and dashboard reporting using tools like Python, SQL, and Power BI.

During my studies, I honed my ability to work with complex data and developed a keen eye for identifying patterns and trends. I also gained experience in data management, and statistical analysis, which I believe will be valuable assets in my role as a data specialist.

In my free time, I enjoy exploring new data analysis tools and techniques, and I am always looking for opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills. Whether working on a team or independently, I am driven by the thrill of discovering new insights and the satisfaction of using data to solve complex problems.

This is a repository to showcase skills, share projects and track my progress in Business Intelligence.

## 📂 Portfolio Projects

### 🎯 Customer Segmentation with RFM Analysis  
**Goal**: To identify and segment customers based on their purchasing behavior in order to improve marketing targeting and customer retention strategies.

**Description**:  
Analyzed 3-month transaction data from a retail platform. The data was transformed from OLTP to OLAP using SQL and used to calculate Recency, Frequency, and Monetary (RFM) values for each customer. Customers were then segmented into strategic groups (VIP, Potential, General, and Secondary) based on their behavior. The segmentation was visualized and explored through interactive dashboards.

**Skills**: ETL, Data Modeling, RFM Analysis, Customer Segmentation, SQL Analytics, Dashboard design.

**Technology**: MS SQL Server, Power BI (DAX, Power Query).

**Results**:  
Created 4 actionable customer segments that revealed clear behavioral patterns. Insights were used to recommend prioritized engagement strategies, such as retention focus for General and Secondary customers, and upselling for Potential customers. The Power BI dashboard allowed dynamic filtering by segment, behavior, and time window.

### 💬 Sentiment Analysis on Vietnamese Customer Feedback  
**Goal**: To analyze customer sentiment from large-scale Vietnamese text data and uncover patterns in user opinions across different content categories and platforms.

**Description**:  
Processed and analyzed 885k customer comments extracted from MongoDB. The data included fields such as comment content, timestamp, category, and platform. Using PhoBERT (a transformer model for Vietnamese), each comment was classified into sentiment categories: positive, negative, or neutral. Results were aggregated and visualized for stakeholder reporting.

**Skills**: Data Wrangling, Natural Language Processing (NLP), Sentiment Classification, ETL, Data Visualization.

**Technology**: Python (Pandas, Torch, Transformers), PhoBERT, MongoDB, Power BI.

**Results**:  
The analysis showed that content with niche themes received more positive reactions, while sports and event-related content had higher polarity (more extreme sentiment). Results helped stakeholders tailor content strategies per category and platform. Batch processing was implemented to optimize runtime for nearly 900K entries.
